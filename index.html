	<p>Throughout the ages, the city of Yharnam has lain under an ancient curse; a nightmare known only as the Scourge of the Beast.

	The curse infects the city’s inhabitants, making those affected lose all sense of reason and humanity, transforming them into hideous creatures that stalk the streets. Streets which are darkly sinister – but at the same time hauntingly beautiful.

	Yharnam’s only hope are the Hunters – guardians who rise up to cleanse the terrifying streets night after night.
